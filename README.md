# pesonalized Email Generator

This project is designed to automate the process of generating cold emails for job postings. It scrapes job descriptions from user-provided URLs, extracts relevant job details, queries a portfolio of tech stacks and links from a Chroma vector store, and generates a personalized cold email to send to potential clients.

## Features
- Scrapes job postings from a URL.
- Extracts role, experience, skills, and description in JSON format.
- Queries a portfolio collection of relevant tech stacks and links using Chroma vector store.
- Generates personalized cold emails with relevant portfolio links using Groq and LLMs.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed below)
  
## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install chromadb langchain langchain_groq pandas
```

### Step 2: Add Your API Key and LLM Model Name
To use Groq's Chat model, you'll need to add your **API key** and **LLM model name**. 

In the `groq_api_key` and `model_name` fields, replace `'YOUR API KEY'` with your actual Groq API key and set the model name to the one you are using (e.g., `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`).

```python
llm = ChatGroq(
    temperature=0, 
    groq_api_key='YOUR API KEY',  # Replace with your Groq API key
    model_name="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"  # Set the desired model name
)
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Portfolio CSV File
Make sure your portfolio data is in a CSV file named `my_portfolio.csv`, containing the following columns:
- `Techstack`: The tech stack of your portfolio items.
- `Links`: Links to the relevant portfolio items.

Example:
```csv
Techstack,Links
"Machine Learning", "https://portfolio.com/ml_project"
"Web Development", "https://portfolio.com/web_project"
```

### Step 4: Run the Script
Once everything is set up, run the script. The program will ask for a job posting URL. After inputting the URL, it will generate a cold email tailored to the job description with relevant portfolio links.

```bash
python generate_cold_email.py
```

### Step 5: Result
The script will print the generated cold email based on the job description, portfolio links, and personalized content.

## Code Overview
- **Job Scraping and Data Extraction**: The `WebBaseLoader` loads job posting data from the URL, and a Groq-based LLM model extracts job details.
- **Portfolio Search**: The Chroma client searches the portfolio vector store for tech stacks related to the extracted skills from the job description.
- **Email Generation**: A Groq-based LLM model is used to generate the cold email using the job description and portfolio links.

## Notes
- Make sure to replace the API key and model name with your own credentials.
- The generated emails are designed for a business development role at AtliQ, an AI & software consulting company.
